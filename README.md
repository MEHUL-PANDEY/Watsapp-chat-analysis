# Watsapp-chat-analysis
Watsapp chat analyzer is a python based project used for getting a broad review of a watsapp chat text file.
It is a simple project in which you can easily import a txt file of a chat between individuals or a group and know all kind of trends followed on that chat.
for example:
1. daily chat duration
2. monthly activeness
3. yearly activeness
4. most active person
5. most active day of the week
6. frequently used words
7. emojis used in chat

The project aimed to summarize all the details to be known for checking the activeness and details of any chat file.
i had used %%capture to hide my code outputs as the chat used by me for the testing purpose was my own chat.
